Device configuration for Samsung Galaxy S4 Exynos (GT-I9500)

Copyright 2016, The CyanogenMod Project / GearCM

Current build version: WIP

Actual Status:

- Issues with VOIP Calls (due to some standby issue, Audio HAL needs to be fixed)
- Mixer Paths needs to be entirely reconfigured to get proper audio quality
- Wi-Fi isn't 100% stable, the issue seems to be on the kernel side
- Incompatibilities with Snap Camera needs to be fixed (not so important though)
- Camera isn't 100% stable, there are some issues with ION & v4l2
- SIM-Card STK Toolkit doesn't work properly, SMSs aren't properly sent (corrupted or something)
- HDMI Audio isn't 100% stable, sometimes doesn't work, sometimes crashes the device after some minutes
- SELinux policies aren't ready yet, so the device is running without it until they are properly fixed
